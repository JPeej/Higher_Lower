<h1 align="center">Higher Lower</h1>

I was tasked to create a Higher Lower game in my class, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Wu. I am taking this Udemy class on the side of my official coursework at Western Governors University. This is day fourteen of the class.

<h2>I was to focus on using the following concepts that I learned today.</h2>

-Review concepts within the beginner section of the class. 

<h2>What I learned</h2>
I learned how to make it so the game doesn't use a duplicate within the game. A bug I ran into was it was giving the same person as A and B. This would always lead to a wrong answer and end the game. By using:

```
game_data.data.remove(x)
```

I stopped this bug from occuring.

<h2>Issues I had and where I can do better.</h2>
None! Today felt really good. It has been awhile since uploading due to school work.
